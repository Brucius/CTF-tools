# CTFTools
Quick hacky tools created for CTFs.
Everything is written and can be run in Python3.

Example to convert bas64 to a string : run as below
```console
python3 base642String.py
```

Key in your base64. E.g (ZnNvY2lldHk=) in base64 is 'fsociety'
```console
ZnNvY2lldHk=
```

Output will be written to **stringBaseFlag.txt** file with prefix **picoCTF**
```console
picoCTF{fsociety}
```

## TODO 
- [ ] merge base to string conversions to handle multipl of them in one script.

Contributions are welcome.
